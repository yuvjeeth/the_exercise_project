  "In daily life, you often need to push against objects, from doors to shopping carts. The functional fitness you develop with push-ups provides the strength needed to perform these movements. \n\nIn particular, push-ups help strengthen your arms, chest, back and core which constitute of almost all of your upper body muscle groups.",
  "A pull-up is an upper-body exercise that involves hanging from a pull-up bar by your hands with your palms facing away from you, and lifting your entire body up with your arm and back muscles until your chest touches the bar.\n\nThe pull-up movement uses multiple muscles at once, including your arms, shoulders, back and core, making it a compound exercise."
